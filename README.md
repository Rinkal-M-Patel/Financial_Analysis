## Lessons Learned

. I learned how to store and manipulate transaction data using arrays and objects.

. Iterate over an array using a for loop.

. I encountered and resolved various bugs and issues. This experience enhanced my debugging skills and taught me how to effectively troubleshoot JavaScript code using techniques like console logging, stepping through code, and using browser developer tools.

. I learned the importance of modular code organization. Breaking down the application into smaller, modular functions and files improved code readability.

. This project taught me the importance of project planning and time management.


## Credits
